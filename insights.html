        <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="intro">
        <p>The increasing complexity of modern electricity grids, driven by a mix of renewable energy sources and varying consumption patterns, has made the accurate forecasting of electricity demand more essential than ever. As grids evolve, so does the necessity for more nuanced and data-driven approaches to manage them effectively.</p>
        <p>This analysis is rooted in a comprehensive dataset that spans from March 18, 2017, to January 15, 2021. While the geographic location and the specific consumer demographics related to the data are not explicitly known, the time range uniquely positions us to analyze shifts in electricity demand, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
        <h1 class="no-margin-padding">Objectives</h1>
        <p class="no-margin-padding">Our primary objectives are threefold:</p>
        <p>1. <b>Identify Patterns in Electricity Usage</b>: Understanding trends and anomalies in the data can guide efficient grid management and potentially result in cost savings for both suppliers and consumers.</p>
        <p>2. <b>Assess the Impact of COVID-19 on Electricity Demand</b>: The pandemic has upended typical consumption patterns, and analyzing these shifts can offer insights into the resilience and adaptability of electricity grids during unprecedented events.</p>
        <p>3. <b>Uncover Correlations for Forecasting</b>: By studying various factors that may correlate with electricity demand, we aim to build a foundation for more accurate and dynamic forecasting models.</p>

        <p>We observe from above that the following dataset is clearly seasonal. During the last few months of each year there 
            is a great decrease in electricity demand and load overall in the city. It is also important to note that these drops 
            begin just before the end of the year and begin to reach their peaks again towards the end of the summer months. 
            This signified that there is a surge in load over the colder months of the year, indicating that this may be due to 
            the use greater use of heaters and other winter related appliances. </p>
        <p>What is also visible is that there is a significant decrease in electricity demand in the first quarter of the year 
            2020, this is the time where the COVID-19 pandemic hit Australia. The pandemic led to industries being forced to shut 
            down and the inclusion of remote work for workers to comply to COVID-19 protocols. This signifies that this area may 
            be in an industrialised. This insight is further supported by observing that where there is supposed to be a peak in 
            load with respect to previous data, there is actually a trough.</p>
